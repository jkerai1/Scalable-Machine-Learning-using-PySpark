# Scalable-Machine-Learning-using-PySpark
This project looked at scalable machine learning for a movie recomemdantion set utilising ALS (alternative least squares)

A NASA data set was used as a familiarisation to pySpark. The data was plotted using matplotlib.

Note: I achieved 100/100 for this project
